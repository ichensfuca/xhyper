Type ? for help.  Type <Ctrl>-D to quit.
The resultant of A and B with respect to x (resp. y) is a constant times y 
(resp. x).
The constant in both cases is only divisible by primes above 11.
We conclude over primes away from 2 and 11, F has semi-stable reduction.
**********************
Case 4 divides a for F
**********************
We expand c_4, c_6, Delta into powers of a in order of increasing degree.
The valuations of the coefficients are:
[ 8, 8, 8, 8, 8 ]
[ 11, 11, 11, 12, 11, 11, 11 ]
[ 16, 17, 16, 17, 16, 17, 17, 17, 16, 17, 16, 17, 16 ]
Thus we have that (v(c_4), v(c_6), v(Delta)) = (8, 11, 16).
We twist by 1/4 to get a model with (v(c_4), v(c_6), v(Delta)) = (4, 5, 4).
To use Papadopoulos Table IV for showing the reduction type is III and conductor
exponent f = 3, we would still need to check supplementary conditions.
Instead, we note since the discriminant has valuation 4, the model is minimal 
and only one round of Tate's algorithm is needed.
Hence sampling modulo 2^6 is sufficient to establish the conductor exponent f = 
3.
Proving conductor exponent f = 3 by sampling modulo 2^6 ... done.

**************************
Case 8 divides a + b for F
**************************
We expand c_4, c_6, Delta into powers of a+b in order of increasing degree.
The valuations of the coefficients are:
[ 8, 9, 8, 8, 8 ]
[ 12, 12, 11, 12, 11, 11, 11 ]
[ Infinity, Infinity, Infinity, Infinity, 16, 18, 17, 17, 16, 17, 16, 17, 16 ]
Thus we have that (v(c_4), v(c_6), v(Delta)) = (8, 12, gt 24).
By Papadopoulos Table IV, the reduction type is I_n, n > 0, and conductor 
exponent f = 1.
Double checking these valuations by sampling ... done.

***************************
Case 11 divides a + b for F
***************************
We expand c_4, c_6, Delta into powers of a+b in order of increasing degree.
The valuations of the coefficients are:
[ 4, 4, 3, 3, 2 ]
[ 6, 6, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3 ]
[ Infinity, Infinity, Infinity, Infinity, 10, 10, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 7, 6 ]
Thus we have that (v(c_4), v(c_6), v(Delta)) = (4, 6, gt 12)
By Papadopoulos Table IV, the reduction type is I_n, n > 0, and conductor 
exponent f = 1.
Double checking these valuations by sampling ... done.

**************************************************
Case 11 does not divide a + b for E twisted by -11
**************************************************
We expand c_4, c_6, Delta into powers of a+b in order of increasing degree.
The valuations of the coefficients are:
[ 14, 14, 13, 13, 12 ]
[ 21, 21, 20, 20, 19, 19, 18 ]
[ Infinity, Infinity, Infinity, Infinity, 40, 40, 39, 39, 39, 39, 37, 37, 36 ]
Thus we have that (v(c_4), v(c_6), v(Delta)) = (12, 18, 36).
By Papadopoulos Table IV, the reduction type is I_0 and conductor exponent f = 
0.
Double checking these valuations by sampling ... done.
