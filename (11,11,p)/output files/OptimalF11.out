Computing forms at level I2 ...
Done !
There are  1 newforms
The degrees of coefficient fields are [ 2 ]
++++++++++++++++++++++ Total running time (in hours) = 0.001

Performing standard elimination for 1 form(s) with set of auxiliary primes [ 3, 
23 ]

Checking form no 1

Dealing with q = 3
This form can be eliminated for large enough p !
Dealing with q = 23
Form no 1
with coefficient field : Number Field with defining polynomial x^2 + x - 1 over 
the Rational Field
is not eliminated for prime(s) : { 5, 31 }
*************************************************************

The refined elimination with q = 23 works. The form is eliminated for the given 
subset of primes above p = 31
Running time for this form (in seconds) = 0.330

0.03333333334
30*x - 1
1.164153218E-10
This shows that Zeta_Kf(-1) = 1/30
Eliminated all forms at level I2
++++++++++++++++++++++ Total running time (in hours) = 0.002

Computing forms at level I2*I11...
Done !
There are  2 newforms
The degrees of coefficient fields are [ 5, 5 ]
++++++++++++++++++++++ Total running time (in hours) = 0.003

Performing standard elimination for 2 form(s) with set of auxiliary primes [ 3,

Dealing with q = 23
Form no 1 is eliminated
*************************************************************

Checking form no 2

Dealing with q = 3
