PART B : eliminating in the case 7 dividing a+b


Eliminating the case ab odd

Computing forms at level N3 = I2*I3*I7...
Done !
There are  5 newforms
++++++++++++++++++++++ 0.000
We first perform standard elimination at level N3 = I2*I3*I7 using primes q = 
13, 29 and 41 and the Frey curve not twisted :
Performing standard elimination for 5 form(s) with set of auxiliary primes [ 5, 
13, 29, 41 ]

Checking form no 1

Dealing with q = 5
This form can be eliminated for large enough p !
Dealing with q = 13
Dealing with q = 29
Form no 1 is eliminated
*************************************************************

Checking form no 2

Dealing with q = 5
This form can be eliminated for large enough p !
Dealing with q = 13
Form no 2 is eliminated
*************************************************************

Checking form no 3

Dealing with q = 5
This form can be eliminated for large enough p !
Dealing with q = 13
Dealing with q = 29
Dealing with q = 41
Form no 3
with coefficient field : Number Field with defining polynomial x^3 - 3*x^2 - 
    10*x - 1 over the Rational Field
is not eliminated for prime(s) : { 5, 13 }
*************************************************************

Checking form no 4

Dealing with q = 5
This form can be eliminated for large enough p !
Dealing with q = 13
Dealing with q = 29
Dealing with q = 41
Form no 4 is eliminated
*************************************************************

Checking form no 5

Dealing with q = 5
This form can be eliminated for large enough p !
Dealing with q = 13
Form no 5 is eliminated
*************************************************************

++++++++++++++++++++++ 0.003

The prime p = 11 survives for the form no 4 ; we discard it using refined 
elimination with q = 5 :
Performing refined elimination with set of auxiliary primes [ 5 ]

Dealing with q = 5
This form can be eliminated for large enough p !
The form with coefficient field : Number Field with defining polynomial x^3 - 
    x^2 - 30*x - 27 over the Rational Field
is not eliminated for 6 prime ideal(s) above : { 13, 67, 125, 205379 }

The primes p = 5, 13 survives for the form no 3 ; we discard p = 5 using refined
elimination with q = 29 :
Performing refined elimination with set of auxiliary primes [ 29 ]

Dealing with q = 29
This form can be eliminated for large enough p !
The form with coefficient field : Number Field with defining polynomial x^3 - 
    3*x^2 - 10*x - 1 over the Rational Field
is not eliminated for 2 prime ideal(s) above : { 13, 24389 }

For each form f at level N3 = I2*I3*I7, we compute Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 
13 for any of the three prime ideals Q above 29 in K :

Form no 1 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 7
Form no 2 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 12
Form no 3 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 0
Form no 4 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 8
Form no 5 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 12

Hence form no 3 is the *unique* form with reducible mod 13 representation whose 
existence is predicted by Martin's result.
It has exactly 1 prime ideal above 13 in its coefficient field.
