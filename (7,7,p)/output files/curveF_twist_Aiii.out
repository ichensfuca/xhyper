PART A : eliminating in the case 7 not dividing a+b


Eliminating the case ab even...

Computing forms at level N2 = I2^3*I3...
Done !
There are  47 newforms
++++++++++++++++++++++ 0.001

... with ab divisible by 4

This is the same level as before but with a different twist for the Frey curve.
We first perform standard elimination at level N2 = I2^3*I3 using primes q = 13,
29 and 41 and the Frey curve twisted by -7 :
Performing standard elimination for 47 form(s) with set of auxiliary primes [ 5,
13, 29, 41 ]
