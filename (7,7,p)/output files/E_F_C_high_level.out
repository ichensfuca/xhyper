Computing forms at level I2*I3*I7...
Done !
There are  5 newforms
++++++++++++++++++++++ Total running time (in hours) = 0.003

We first perform standard elimination at level I2*I3*I7 using primes q = 5, 13, 
29 and 41 and the Frey curve not twisted :
Form no 1 is eliminated
Form no 2 is eliminated
Form no 3 is not eliminated for prime(s) : { 5, 13 }
Form no 4 is eliminated
Form no 5 is eliminated

++++++++++++++++++++++ Total running time (in hours) = 0.004


The primes p = 5, 13 survive for the form no 3 ; we discard p = 5 using refined 
elimination with q = 29 :

++++++++++++++++++++++
The refined elimination with q = 29 works. The form is eliminated for p = 5

For each form f at level I2*I3*I7, we compute Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 
for any of the three prime ideals Q above 29 in K :

Form no 1 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 7
Form no 2 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 12
Form no 3 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 0
Form no 4 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 8
Form no 5 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 12

Hence form no 3 is the *unique* form with reducible mod 13 representation whose 
existence is predicted by Martin's result.
It has exactly 1 prime ideal above 13 in its coefficient field.

* Using the curve C, we rule out the case ab even                 *
* and hence case (1) and the remaining (sub-)case (2) when 2||ab. *

Computing forms at level I2^2*I3*I7^2...

There are 61 newforms at level I2^2*I3*I7^2.
++++++++++++++++++++++ Total running time (in hours) = 0.196

Eliminating forms by checking whether K is included in the field of 
coefficients..
..done.

We first determine which of these forms are quadratic twists by the mod 7 
cyclotomic character (which is quadratic when restricted to K) of forms in the 
two possible smaller levels.

Computing forms at level I2^2*I3..
..done. 0.199
Computing forms in level I2^2*I3*I7..
..done. 0.200

Degrees of the coefficient fields of the forms at level I2^2*I3:
[ 1, 3, 3, 9 ]

Degrees of the coefficient fields of the forms at level I2^2*I3*I7:
[ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 9, 9, 9, 9, 12, 12, 12, 15 ]

Degrees of the coefficient fields of the forms no 12, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 
22, 23, 24, 26, 28, 33, 38, 41, 42, 45, 46, 47, 48, 51, 57, 58, 60, 61 (i.e. 
whose coefficient field contains K) at level I2^2*I3*I7^2:
[ 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 9, 12, 12, 15, 18, 18, 21, 21, 36, 36, 
54, 54 ]

The forms at level I2^2*I3*I7^2 with coefficient field (containing K) of degree 
> 15 do not arise from lower level.

We look for the forms in level I2^2*I3*I7^2 whose coefficient field contains K 
and has degree <= 15 and such that they arise by quadratic twist from level 
I2^2*I3 or I2^2*I3*I7.

Checking for forms that arises from twisting forms at level I2^2*I3 by comparing
the coefficient fields..
Form no 38 with field of degree 9 seems to be arising by quadratic twist from 
form no 4 in level I2^2*I3
Checked all forms.
Since there are no repetitions of the first form number we conclude that the 
Galois conjugacy classes of the previous pairs of forms are related by quadratic
twist.

Checking for forms f in level I2^2*I3*I7^2 that arise by twisting forms at level
I2^2*I3*I7 by comparing the coefficient fields for forms f such that [Kf:Q]>3 
and by comparing the Fourier coefficient at I11 for forms f such that [Kf:Q] = 3
(i.e. Kf is isomorphic to K)..
Form no 26 with field of degree 3 seems to be arising by quadratic twist from 
form no 9 in level I2^2*I3*I7
Form no 16 with field of degree 3 seems to be arising by quadratic twist from 
form no 10 in level I2^2*I3*I7
Form no 33 with field of degree 9  seems to be arising by quadratic twist from 
form no  15  in level I2^2*I3*I7
Form no 42 with field of degree 12  seems to be arising by quadratic twist from 
form no  17  in level I2^2*I3*I7
Form no 41 with field of degree 12  seems to be arising by quadratic twist from 
form no  18  in level I2^2*I3*I7
Form no 45 with field of degree 15  seems to be arising by quadratic twist from 
form no  19  in level I2^2*I3*I7
Checked all forms.
Since there are no repetitions of the first form number we conclude that the 
Galois conjugacy classes of the previous pairs of forms are related by quadratic
twist.

We conclude that at the level I2^2*I3*I7^2 all the forms of degree 9, 12, 15 and
two of degree 3 arise from smaller levels by quadratic twist.

It remains to determine wich forms in level I2^2*I3*I7^2 are quadratic twists of
each other by the same character:

Forms no 46 and 47 are twists of each other as they are the only forms with 
coefficient field of degree 18
Forms no 60 and 61 are twists of each other as they are the only forms with 
coefficient field of degree 54
Forms no 48 and 51 are twists of each other as they are the only forms with 
coefficient field of degree 21 containing K.
Forms no 57 and 58 are twists of each other as they are the only forms with 
coefficient field of degree 36 containing K.
Next we show that the remaining 10 forms of level I2^2*I3*I7^2 with Deg(Kf) = 3 
appear in 5 pairs of quadratic twists..
Form no  12  seems to be a quadratic twist of form no  28
Form no  17  seems to be a quadratic twist of form no  24
Form no  18  seems to be a quadratic twist of form no  19
Form no  20  seems to be a quadratic twist of form no  21
Form no  22  seems to be a quadratic twist of form no  23
Checked all forms.
Since there are no repetitions of the first form number we conclude that the 
Galois conjugacy classes of the previous pairs of forms are related by quadratic
twist.

We first eliminate the forms that arise from a smaller level by the quadratic 
twist corresponding to L/K where L = Cyclotomic(7)

Form no 38 is eliminated because it is a quadratic twist of a form at level 
I2^2*I3, while the conductor of the Frey variety at I7 has exponent 1 or 2 up to
qudratic twist.
