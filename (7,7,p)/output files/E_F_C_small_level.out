Computing forms at level I2*I3*I7...
Done !
There are  5 newforms
++++++++++++++++++++++ Total running time (in hours) = 0.008

We first perform standard elimination at level I2*I3*I7 using primes q = 5, 13, 
29 and 41 and the Frey curve not twisted :
Form no 1 is eliminated
Form no 2 is eliminated
Form no 3 is not eliminated for prime(s) : { 5, 13 }
Form no 4 is eliminated
Form no 5 is eliminated

++++++++++++++++++++++ Total running time (in hours) = 0.010


The primes p = 5, 13 survive for the form no 3 ; we discard p = 5 using refined 
elimination with q = 29 :

++++++++++++++++++++++
The refined elimination with q = 29 works. The form is eliminated for p = 5

For each form f at level I2*I3*I7, we compute Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 
for any of the three prime ideals Q above 29 in K :

Form no 1 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 7
Form no 2 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 12
Form no 3 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 0
Form no 4 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 8
Form no 5 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 12

Hence form no 3 is the *unique* form with reducible mod 13 representation whose 
existence is predicted by Martin's result.
It has exactly 1 prime ideal above 13 in its coefficient field.

Since 7 divides a+b, we know that our Frey representation arises after twisting 
by the mod 7 cyclotomic character (which is quadratic when restricted to K) from
a form of level I2^2*I3*I7.
