For each form f at level N3 = I2*I3*I7, we compute Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 
13 for any of the three prime ideals Q above 29 in K :

Form no 1 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 7
Form no 2 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 12
Form no 3 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 0
Form no 4 : Norm(a_Q(f)-(Norm(Q)+1)) mod 13 = 8
